// Ninjaâ€™s Training

// Ninja is planning a training schedule for N days. Each day, he can choose one of three activities: Running, Fighting Practice, or Learning New Moves. 
// Each activity has associated merit points for each day. Ninja cannot repeat the same activity on consecutive days.

// Given a 2D array POINTS of size N x 3, where POINTS[i][j] represents the merit points for the j-th activity on the i-th day, find the maximum merit points Ninja can earn.

// For POINTS = [[1, 2, 5], [3, 1, 1], [3, 3, 3]], the maximum merit points Ninja can earn is 11 by choosing activities with merit points 5 (Day 1) + 3 (Day 2) + 3 (Day 3).
